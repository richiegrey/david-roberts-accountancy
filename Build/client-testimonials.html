							<h3>Client Testimonials</h3>
							   
							   	
								<p>As we are a rapidly expanding Company, we decided that we needed more help from our accountant.
								By switching to David Roberts Accountancy Services, we made a significant cost saving, compared to what we were previously paying for standard accountancy services (Annual Accounts, tax, VAT, Payroll etc).  
								But more importantly, we are now getting monthly Management Accounts and unlimited support, which are a massive help in running our business more effectively and profitably!</p>
								<h5>David Coates, Owner First4Fishing.Com Ltd</h5>

								
								<p>David Roberts Accountancy Services comes highly recommended from us all at Port Talbot Magnet and Local News South Wales Ltd. David provides a first-class service, tailor made for his client’s needs and size of business. His attention to detail and meticulous approach, along with a willingness to work to tight deadlines from scratch, was exemplary and of enormous assistance to us as a small start-up business.</p>
								<h5>Ken Smith and Rachel Howells, directors at Port Talbot Magnet/Local News South Wales Ltd</h5>

								
								<p>After paying our previous Accountant a significant amount to set up the company for us, we found we were getting zero help &amp; support. We then decided to switch to David and were amazed at the service we received.  He was always there to answer our queries and was only too willing to guide us through the opening months of our business!  Much more support, for less than we were previously paying! A* Service!</p>
								<h5>Jason Williams, Owner Castech Engineering Ltd</h5>


								
								<p>Had the taxman knocking on my door. 4 years behind owing £13,000. Mr Roberts got on the case and I got a refund. Highly recommended.</p>
								<h5>Michael Williams (CIS Contractor)</h5>


								
								<p>I couldn’t believe the difference in the level of support and quality of service after appointing David to be my accountant. As well as an accountant, he has become a valued business advisor and always takes the time to explain the numbers and really cares about seeing my business doing well!</p>
								<h5>Stacey Adamiec, Owner Revue Dance Studios</h5>


								
								<p>We made a huge saving by switching to David Roberts and we are receiving a much better, more personal service from him. He is always ready to help us, whenever we need him and would recommend him to any other sports clubs who want good value for money!</p>
								<h5>Stuart Mort, Treasurer Baglan Rugby Football Club</h5>


								
								<p>After setting up my own business David took care of my accounts and took away the hassle of dealing with HMRC for me. He also helped me to become an employer and now runs my payroll for me each month, freeing up my time to concentrate on building up my business. I would advise anyone going self employed, to get in touch with David.</p>
